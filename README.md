# DrinkingWater
DrinkingWater is an idea plugin that reminds you to drink water.

Bacteria multiply every 25 minutes, 
so you can drink and rinse your mouth every 15-20 minutes to reduce the bacteria in your mouth. 
Drinking the right amount of water regularly helps you to be healthy. 
Ask weakly, is your hair still there? Pay attention to health and peers!
